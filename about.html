  <h2>My name is Andrew Abbott and I am learning to build websites.</h2>
  <p>Since April 2020 I have studied front end web development. My goal is to provide immense value to companies that have dedicated themselves to helping others in a meaningful way.</p>
  <p>My current project is buiding a personal website that is functional and attractive using purely HTML and CSS. Making it responsive using a mobile-first design is proving challenging and is currently a work in progress. Meanwhile, I am starting to learn JavaScript while getting involved in and contributing to the software development community.</p>

  <h2>The Road to Here</h2>
  <p>I graduated from Arizona State University with a B.A. in Anthropology, a B.A. in Russian, and almost no idea of what to do next. I've always done very well when given direction (i.e. "get good grades"), but now I needed to determine the next direction (although doing so four years earlier would have been much more helpful).</p>
  <p>I worked for several years at a major financial institution, but always held a desire to get into the military, a three letter agency or law enforcement - a career that would let me help others in a major and meaningful way.</p>
  <p>I married the girl of my dreams, and a few years later, we had a son. The primary focus, now, has shifted to providing the best life possible for the three of us. I decided the ideal career should include the following (in this order):</p>
  <img class="img-float-r" src="images/us-camping-400w.jpg" alt="Me, wife and son camping in forest">
  <ol>
    <li>A good, flexible lifestyle with the ability to work remotely</li>
    <li>A desire for me to become a subject matter expert</li>
    <li>The ability to meaningfully help others</li>
    <li>Good income</li>
    <li>Be challenging, difficult and somewhat prestigious</li>
  </ol>
  <p>It quickly became apparent that a career in computer science or software engineering would be an excellent fit. While I don't feel an inherent passion for it, I've heard it said that you donâ€™t do work because you're passionate, but instead, find passion in doing the work.  To date, I can say this idea has held true. More importantly, when I can connect the lines of code I write to a goal that truly helps someone else, I find purpose.</p>

  <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
  <p>I've set a goal to get hired as a front-end software developer by April 2021. According to others who have shared their journey, going from <em>brand new</em> to <em>valuable enough to get paid</em> within one year is ambitious but doable. The pathway I've constructed changes frequently, but developing a deep understanding vanilla JavaScript and applying it to solve real world problems, however minor they may be initially, is the next step.</p>
