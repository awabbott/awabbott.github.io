  <h1>Our Backyard Project</h1>
  <p>My wife and I bought a massive project of a house in 2017. It was close to her family and we got a decent deal on it due to all the sweat equity needed. We downsized from our previous house not knowing that we had an addition to the family on the way. As of May 2020 we've come a long way but are still not quite done. My purpose in writing this is threefold:</p>
  <ol style="font-size:14;margin:35px;">
    <li>Document the yard's transition from a barren wasteland to an inviting space to play and relax</li>
	<li>Explain the steps we took in detail to help anyone considering something similar</li>
	<li>Practise web development</li>
  </ol>
  <p>I hope you gain something useful from our successes and failures or at least enjoy the before and after pictures.</p>

<p>Initially, the yard was surrounded by a dilapidated wooden fence. It had completely fallen in two places and could easily be knocked down everywhere else. Anything in the backyard was easily visible and accessible to others. We've had a vacant house broken into before and decided our first steps should be to ensure this doesn't happen again. We had a block wall installed to replace the fence. We decided on one 5' gate and one 12' double gate on the side for RV parking since we have a corner lot. We also had an 8' x 12' shed installed for $2,000 total through <a href="http://www.shedliquidators.com/index.php/" target="_blank" title="www.shedliquidators.com">Shed Liquidators</a>. The studs are 1" x 3" and the door tends to sag, but the shed has served its purpose well. There are no pictures from before, but here are a few photos taken shortly after the wall and shed were put in.</p>
