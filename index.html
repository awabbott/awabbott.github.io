		<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I am the husband to an amazing wife and father to an andorable 2 year old son.</p>
	<p>I value learning and being challenged over stagnation and complacency, which has gradually drawn me toward a career web development.</p>
	<p>My time is usually spent enjoying every moment with my family. My main hobby is DIY house projects.</p>

	<h1>Landscaping Project</h1>
	<p>My wife and I bought a <strong>massive project of a house</strong> in 2017, but we got a decent deal on it due to all the sweat equity needed. We downsized from our previous house not knowing that we had an addition to the family on the way. We've come a long way but still have plenty to do.</p>
	<p>For the benefit of anyone else considering something similar we have documented the process and explained the steps in detail (successes and failures).</p>

	<h1>Web Development</h1>
	<p>As for my future career, web development seems like an excellent fit. I decided the ideal career should have the following qualities:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>A good lifestyle I can enjoy with my family (ideally working from home)</li>
		<li>Desire to be a subject matter expert in my chosen profession (I've been an expert before only to realize it was in the wrong profession)</li>
		<li>Connection to something meaningful (e.g. helping schools/businesses/government operate more efficiently)</li>
		<li>Good income</li>
		<li>Difficult, challenging, somewhat prestigious</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Computer science fits this description, and after some research, web development seems like the fastest route. <a href="#">Feel free to read more about my journey here</a>.</p>
